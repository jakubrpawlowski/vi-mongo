## What's New

### Breaking Changes

- **Reverse alwaysConfirmActions behavior **

  To protect users from accidental deletion/duplication without confirmation, `alwaycConfirmActions` will be set to true by default. Only explicitly changing this value in `config.yaml` to false will make it work.

```yaml
    - url: mongodb://localhost:27017
      host: localhost
      options:
        alwaysConfirmActions: false
```
