## What's New

### Features

- **Enhanced CLI Support**
  - Added new flags to connect directly from command line:
    - `-l, --connection-list`: List all available connections
    - `-n, --connection-name string`: Connect to a specific MongoDB connection by name
  - Changed `--connection-page` short flag from `-n` to `-p` to avoid conflicts

- **Improved Navigation**
  - Added `0` and `$` for horizontal movement to first and last column in a row

- **Performance Improvements**
  - `Count` query now runs in background, resulting in much faster response when clicking on collections

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed cursor placement after document deletion (cursor now stays in place of deleted document)
- Fixed `ctrl+d` and `ctrl+u` movement behavior - now strictly vertical movement, staying in the same column
